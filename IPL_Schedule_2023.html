                    The Narendra Modi Stadium (NMS), also known as Motera Stadium, is an international cricket stadium
                    in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India. It is the largest stadium in the world, with a seating capacity of
                    132,000 spectators. The stadium is owned by the Gujarat Cricket Association and serves as the venue
                    for domestic and international cricket matches. It is one of the world's premier cricket stadiums.
                    The Narendra Modi stadium stands on the same plot where the Sardar Patel Stadium was present from
                    1982 to 2015, until its demolition. It served as the main venue of domestic and international
                    cricket in the city till 2015. It hosted some matches during the 1987, 1996, and 2011 ICC World
                    Cups. The Gujarat Cricket Association (GCA) scrapped the Sardar Patel Stadium in 2015 to build a
                    state of the art and the world's biggest cricket stadium. The Narendra Modi stadium is designed by
                    Australia's design firm Populous and built by Larsen and Toubro. It took 5 years to build, at an
                    estimated cost of ₹800 crore (US$100 million). The arena replaced the iconic Melbourne Cricket
                    Ground as the world's largest cricket stadium. The headquarter of the GCA is located in its
                    premises. The Narendra Modi stadium has 4 dressing rooms, 11 center pitches, and 2 practice grounds
                    that can host practice as well as domestic matches etc.
                    On 24 February 2021, the Gujarat Cricket Association (GCA), named this newly built stadium as the
                    Narendra Modi Stadium in honour of the current Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, who was the
                    president of the GCA (2009–2014) and the chief minister of Gujarat (2001–2014). In 2021, the stadium
                    was inaugurated by the president of India, Ram Nath Kovind, in an event he presided over.
                    It was first opened to the public in 2020 amid the Namaste Trump event, organized for president of
                    the United States Donald Trump. On 24 February 2021, the Narendra Modi stadium hosted its first Test
                    match, when home side India played against England, it was also its first ever day-night test
                    game.On 29 September 2022, the opening ceremony of the 36th National games was held in the stadium.
                    The arena hosted the final match of the 2023 ICC World Cup on 19 November

                    The Inderjit Singh Bindra Stadium is a cricket ground located in Mohali, Punjab, India. It is
                    popularly referred to as the Mohali Stadium. The stadium was built by Geetanshu Kalra is home to the
                    Punjab team. The construction of the stadium took around ₹ 250 million and 3 years to complete.[1]
                    The stadium has an official capacity of 26,950[2] spectators. The stadium was designed by Ar. Arun
                    Loomba and Associates, and constructed by R.S. Construction Company based in Chandigarh.[3] Inderjit
                    Singh Bindra stadium is home of Punjab cricket team and Punjab Kings (IPL franchise). The stadium is
                    named after former BCCI president & former PCA president Inderjit Singh Bindra.

                    The floodlights here are unconventional compared to other cricket stadiums, in that the light
                    pillars are very low in height. This is to avoid aircraft from the nearby Chandigarh airport
                    colliding with the light pillars. That is the reason behind the stadium having 16 floodlights. As of
                    December 2019, it has hosted 13 Tests, 25 ODIs and 5 T20Is.

                    The M. Chinnaswamy Stadium is a cricket stadium in Bangalore, Karnataka, India. It is owned by
                    Government of Karnataka and operated by Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA).[3]
                    Flanked by the picturesque Cubbon Park, Queen's Road, Cubbon and uptown MG Road, this
                    five-decade-old stadium is situated in the heart of the city of Bangalore. It regularly hosts Test,
                    ODI, T20I and first-class cricket matches, as well as musical, cultural events. The stadium is the
                    home ground of the Karnataka state cricket team, Karnataka women's cricket team and IPL franchise
                    Royal Challengers Bangalore. It is owned by the Government of Karnataka and has been leased out
                    to the KSCA for a period of 100 years.
                    Formerly known as the Karnataka State Cricket Association Stadium, it was later rechristened in
                    tribute to Mangalam Chinnaswamy, a lawyer from Mandya and the founding member of the Mysore State
                    Cricket Association.[5] He served the KSCA for four decades and was also president of the Board of
                    Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) from 1977 to 1980, latter's National Cricket Academy also
                    situated in the premises of this stadium.
                    It is the first cricket stadium in the world to use solar panels to generate a bulk of the
                    electricity needed to run the stadium. The panels were procured through the "Go Green" initiative
                    of the KSCA. In 2016 a water purification plant was added, and by January 2017 a system of
                    aeration and drainage was in place to avoid matches being curtailed due to a wet outfield

                    The Arun Jaitley Stadium is a cricket stadium owned and operated by the Delhi & District Cricket
                    Association (DDCA) and located on Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg, New Delhi.[2][3] It was established in
                    1883 as the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium, and named after the nearby Kotla fort. It is the second oldest
                    functional international cricket stadium in India, after the Eden Gardens of Kolkata. As of 25
                    October 2019, it has hosted 36 Tests, 29 ODIs and 6 T20I.
                    In a 2017 felicitation ceremony, the DDCA named four stands of the stadium after former India
                    captain Bishan Singh Bedi, former India all-rounder Mohinder Amarnath, former India and Delhi opener
                    Gautam Gambhir. The home team's dressing room was named after Raman Lamba and the away dressing room
                    after Prakash Bhandari.
                    On 12 September 2019, the stadium was renamed in memory of former DDCA President and Finance
                    Minister Arun Jaitley, after his death on 24 August 2019. DDCA president Rajat Sharma said: "It was
                    Arun Jaitley's support and encouragement that players like Virat Kohli, Virender Sehwag, Gautam
                    Gambhir, Ashish Nehra, Rishabh Pant and many others could make India proud."[5] Arun Jaitley has
                    also been credited with turning the stadium into a modern facility, increasing its seating capacity
                    and building better facilities for players during his tenure as DDCA president. The stadium was
                    officially renamed at a function that took place on 12 September 2019. One of the stands of the
                    stadium was named after former Indian captain Virat Kohli on the same date. The name change has been
                    criticised by former Indian captain Bishan Singh Bedi.[6] After announcing the name change, DDCA
                    clarified that only the stadium had been renamed and that the ground would be still called the Feroz
                    Shah Kotla Ground.
                    As of 2024, the India national cricket team had been undefeated for over 37 years in Test
                    matches.[7] India's 12-year unbeaten run in ODIs was brought to an end during Australia's tour of
                    India in 2018-19.

                    Eden Gardens is an international cricket stadium in Kolkata, India. Established in 1864, it is the
                    oldest[4][5][6] and second-largest cricket stadium in India and third-largest in the world. The
                    stadium currently has a capacity of 68,000.[7] It is owned and operated by Cricket Association of
                    Bengal (CAB) and is the home ground of the Kolkata Knight Riders. It houses the headquarters of
                    Cricket Association of Bengal.
                    Eden Gardens is often referred to as home of Indian cricket and has also been described as
                    "cricket's answer to the Colosseum" [8] and called the "Mecca of Indian cricket", due to it being
                    the first purpose-built ground for the sport.[9][10] Eden Gardens has hosted matches in major
                    international competitions including the World Cup, World Twenty20 and Asia Cup. In 1987, Eden
                    Gardens became the second stadium to host a World Cup final. The 2016 ICC World Twenty20 final was
                    held at the stadium, with the West Indies beating England in a closely fought encounter. Eden
                    Gardens witnessed a record crowd of 110,564 in the 1996 India Vs Sri Lanka Cricket World Cup Semi
                    Final.
                    The stadium was established in 1864. The origins of its name are uncertain. According to some, the
                    stadium is named after the Eden Gardens park where it is located, itself named after the Eden
                    sisters, Emily and Fanny, of Lord Auckland, the Governor-General of India (1836–1842).[11] Initially
                    named the 'Auckland Circus Gardens',[12][13] the park was renamed to the 'Eden Gardens' in 1841.[14]
                    However, according to popular culture, Babu Rajchandra Das, the zamindar (landlord) of Janbazar,
                    Kolkata and husband of Rani Rashmoni, gifted one of his biggest gardens, Mar Bagan, besides the
                    river Hooghly, to Lord Auckland and his sister Emily Eden in gratitude for their help in saving his
                    third daughter from a fatal disease. The garden was then renamed to the Eden Gardens.

                    Wankhede Stadium (pronounced [ʋaːnkʰeɖe]) is an international cricket stadium in Mumbai, India.[3]
                    It is owned and operated by Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) and is the home ground of the Mumbai
                    Indians. It houses the headquarters of MCA, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), and
                    the Indian Premier League (IPL).
                    The stadium is situated near Marine Drive in the Churchgate neighbourhood. Several old cricket clubs
                    are near the stadium, including Hindu Gymkhana, Parsi Gymkhana and Cricket Club of India (CCI)
                    The stadium has been host to numerous high-profile cricket matches in the past, most notably the
                    2011 Cricket World Cup Final, in which India defeated Sri Lanka and became the first country to win
                    the Cricket World Cup on home soil. It hosted the last match of Sachin Tendulkar's international
                    career.
                    Previous stadiums
                    Mumbai has seen Test matches played at three different grounds. The Mumbai Gymkhana ground hosted
                    the first-ever Test in India, in 1933–34 against England. After World War II, the Cricket Club of
                    India's (CCI) Brabourne Stadium – the second ground of the city – was used for 17 Tests.

                    The Narendra Modi Stadium (NMS), also known as Motera Stadium, is an international cricket stadium
                    in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India. It is the largest stadium in the world, with a seating capacity of
                    132,000 spectators. The stadium is owned by the Gujarat Cricket Association and serves as the venue
                    for domestic and international cricket matches. It is one of the world's premier cricket stadiums.
                    The Narendra Modi stadium stands on the same plot where the Sardar Patel Stadium was present from
                    1982 to 2015, until its demolition. It served as the main venue of domestic and international
                    cricket in the city till 2015. It hosted some matches during the 1987, 1996, and 2011 ICC World
                    Cups. The Gujarat Cricket Association (GCA) scrapped the Sardar Patel Stadium in 2015 to build a
                    state of the art and the world's biggest cricket stadium. The Narendra Modi stadium is designed by
                    Australia's design firm Populous and built by Larsen and Toubro. It took 5 years to build, at an
                    estimated cost of ₹800 crore (US$100 million). The arena replaced the iconic Melbourne Cricket
                    Ground as the world's largest cricket stadium. The headquarter of the GCA is located in its
                    premises. The Narendra Modi stadium has 4 dressing rooms, 11 center pitches, and 2 practice grounds
                    that can host practice as well as domestic matches etc.
                    On 24 February 2021, the Gujarat Cricket Association (GCA), named this newly built stadium as the
                    Narendra Modi Stadium in honour of the current Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, who was the
                    president of the GCA (2009–2014) and the chief minister of Gujarat (2001–2014). In 2021, the stadium
                    was inaugurated by the president of India, Ram Nath Kovind, in an event he presided over.
                    It was first opened to the public in 2020 amid the Namaste Trump event, organized for president of
                    the United States Donald Trump. On 24 February 2021, the Narendra Modi stadium hosted its first Test
                    match, when home side India played against England, it was also its first ever day-night test
                    game.On 29 September 2022, the opening ceremony of the 36th National games was held in the stadium.
                    The arena hosted the final match of the 2023 ICC World Cup on 19 November

                    The M. Chinnaswamy Stadium is a cricket stadium in Bangalore, Karnataka, India. It is owned by
                    Government of Karnataka and operated by Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA).[3]
                    Flanked by the picturesque Cubbon Park, Queen's Road, Cubbon and uptown MG Road, this
                    five-decade-old stadium is situated in the heart of the city of Bangalore. It regularly hosts Test,
                    ODI, T20I and first-class cricket matches, as well as musical, cultural events. The stadium is the
                    home ground of the Karnataka state cricket team, Karnataka women's cricket team and IPL franchise
                    Royal Challengers Bangalore. It is owned by the Government of Karnataka and has been leased out
                    to the KSCA for a period of 100 years.
                    Formerly known as the Karnataka State Cricket Association Stadium, it was later rechristened in
                    tribute to Mangalam Chinnaswamy, a lawyer from Mandya and the founding member of the Mysore State
                    Cricket Association.[5] He served the KSCA for four decades and was also president of the Board of
                    Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) from 1977 to 1980, latter's National Cricket Academy also
                    situated in the premises of this stadium.
                    It is the first cricket stadium in the world to use solar panels to generate a bulk of the
                    electricity needed to run the stadium. The panels were procured through the "Go Green" initiative
                    of the KSCA. In 2016 a water purification plant was added, and by January 2017 a system of
                    aeration and drainage was in place to avoid matches being curtailed due to a wet outfield

                    The Arun Jaitley Stadium is a cricket stadium owned and operated by the Delhi & District Cricket
                    Association (DDCA) and located on Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg, New Delhi.[2][3] It was established in
                    1883 as the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium, and named after the nearby Kotla fort. It is the second oldest
                    functional international cricket stadium in India, after the Eden Gardens of Kolkata. As of 25
                    October 2019, it has hosted 36 Tests, 29 ODIs and 6 T20I.
                    In a 2017 felicitation ceremony, the DDCA named four stands of the stadium after former India
                    captain Bishan Singh Bedi, former India all-rounder Mohinder Amarnath, former India and Delhi opener
                    Gautam Gambhir. The home team's dressing room was named after Raman Lamba and the away dressing room
                    after Prakash Bhandari.
                    On 12 September 2019, the stadium was renamed in memory of former DDCA President and Finance
                    Minister Arun Jaitley, after his death on 24 August 2019. DDCA president Rajat Sharma said: "It was
                    Arun Jaitley's support and encouragement that players like Virat Kohli, Virender Sehwag, Gautam
                    Gambhir, Ashish Nehra, Rishabh Pant and many others could make India proud."[5] Arun Jaitley has
                    also been credited with turning the stadium into a modern facility, increasing its seating capacity
                    and building better facilities for players during his tenure as DDCA president. The stadium was
                    officially renamed at a function that took place on 12 September 2019. One of the stands of the
                    stadium was named after former Indian captain Virat Kohli on the same date. The name change has been
                    criticised by former Indian captain Bishan Singh Bedi.[6] After announcing the name change, DDCA
                    clarified that only the stadium had been renamed and that the ground would be still called the Feroz
                    Shah Kotla Ground.
                    As of 2024, the India national cricket team had been undefeated for over 37 years in Test
                    matches.[7] India's 12-year unbeaten run in ODIs was brought to an end during Australia's tour of
                    India in 2018-19.

                    The Inderjit Singh Bindra Stadium is a cricket ground located in Mohali, Punjab, India. It is
                    popularly referred to as the Mohali Stadium. The stadium was built by Geetanshu Kalra is home to the
                    Punjab team. The construction of the stadium took around ₹ 250 million and 3 years to complete.[1]
                    The stadium has an official capacity of 26,950[2] spectators. The stadium was designed by Ar. Arun
                    Loomba and Associates, and constructed by R.S. Construction Company based in Chandigarh.[3] Inderjit
                    Singh Bindra stadium is home of Punjab cricket team and Punjab Kings (IPL franchise). The stadium is
                    named after former BCCI president & former PCA president Inderjit Singh Bindra.
                    The floodlights here are unconventional compared to other cricket stadiums, in that the light
                    pillars are very low in height. This is to avoid aircraft from the nearby Chandigarh airport
                    colliding with the light pillars. That is the reason behind the stadium having 16 floodlights. As of
                    December 2019, it has hosted 13 Tests, 25 ODIs and 5 T20Is.

                    "cricket's answer to the Colosseum" [8] and called the "Mecca of Indian cricket", due to it being
                    the first purpose-built ground for the sport.[9][10] Eden Gardens has hosted matches in major
                    international competitions including the World Cup, World Twenty20 and Asia Cup. In 1987, Eden
                    Gardens became the second stadium to host a World Cup final. The 2016 ICC World Twenty20 final was
                    held at the stadium, with the West Indies beating England in a closely fought encounter. Eden
                    Gardens witnessed a record crowd of 110,564 in the 1996 India Vs Sri Lanka Cricket World Cup Semi
                    Final.
                    The stadium was established in 1864. The origins of its name are uncertain. According to some, the
                    stadium is named after the Eden Gardens park where it is located, itself named after the Eden
                    sisters, Emily and Fanny, of Lord Auckland, the Governor-General of India (1836–1842).[11] Initially
                    named the 'Auckland Circus Gardens',[12][13] the park was renamed to the 'Eden Gardens' in 1841.[14]
                    However, according to popular culture, Babu Rajchandra Das, the zamindar (landlord) of Janbazar,
                    Kolkata and husband of Rani Rashmoni, gifted one of his biggest gardens, Mar Bagan, besides the
                    river Hooghly, to Lord Auckland and his sister Emily Eden in gratitude for their help in saving his
                    third daughter from a fatal disease. The garden was then renamed to the Eden Gardens.

                    The M. Chinnaswamy Stadium is a cricket stadium in Bangalore, Karnataka, India. It is owned by
                    Government of Karnataka and operated by Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA).[3]
                    Flanked by the picturesque Cubbon Park, Queen's Road, Cubbon and uptown MG Road, this
                    five-decade-old stadium is situated in the heart of the city of Bangalore. It regularly hosts Test,
                    ODI, T20I and first-class cricket matches, as well as musical, cultural events. The stadium is the
                    home ground of the Karnataka state cricket team, Karnataka women's cricket team and IPL franchise
                    Royal Challengers Bangalore. It is owned by the Government of Karnataka and has been leased out
                    to the KSCA for a period of 100 years.
                    Formerly known as the Karnataka State Cricket Association Stadium, it was later rechristened in
                    tribute to Mangalam Chinnaswamy, a lawyer from Mandya and the founding member of the Mysore State
                    Cricket Association.[5] He served the KSCA for four decades and was also president of the Board of
                    Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) from 1977 to 1980, latter's National Cricket Academy also
                    situated in the premises of this stadium.
                    It is the first cricket stadium in the world to use solar panels to generate a bulk of the
                    electricity needed to run the stadium. The panels were procured through the "Go Green" initiative
                    of the KSCA. In 2016 a water purification plant was added, and by January 2017 a system of
                    aeration and drainage was in place to avoid matches being curtailed due to a wet outfield

                    international cricket stadium in Mumbai, India.[3] It is owned and operated by Mumbai Cricket
                    Association (MCA) and is the home ground of the Mumbai Indians. It houses the headquarters of MCA,
                    the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), and the Indian Premier League (IPL).
                    The stadium is situated near Marine Drive in the Churchgate neighbourhood. Several old cricket clubs
                    are near the stadium, including Hindu Gymkhana, Parsi Gymkhana and Cricket Club of India (CCI).
                    The stadium has been host to numerous high-profile cricket matches in the past, most notably the
                    2011 Cricket World Cup Final, in which India defeated Sri Lanka and became the first country to win
                    the Cricket World Cup on home soil. It hosted the last match of Sachin Tendulkar's international
                    career.
                    Wankhede Stadium was built after disputes between the CCI, which owns Brabourne Stadium, and the
                    Bombay Cricket Association (BCA; now Mumbai Cricket Association) over the allocation of tickets for
                    cricket matches.[4] This became severe after the Test between India and England in 1973. At the
                    initiative of S. K. Wankhede, a politician and the secretary of the Mumbai Cricket Association, BCA
                    built the new stadium in South Bombay (now South Mumbai) near the Churchgate station by appointing
                    Shashi Prabhu & Associates as their architects and B.E. Billimoria & Co as the contractors. It was
                    named after Wankhede in 1974.[citation needed] It was built in approximately 13 months and opened in
                    time for the final Test between India and the West Indies in 1975.[5] Since then, Wankhede Stadium
                    has been the main cricketing venue in the city.

                    Loomba and Associates, and constructed by R.S. Construction Company based in Chandigarh.[3] Inderjit
                    Singh Bindra stadium is home of Punjab cricket team and Punjab Kings (IPL franchise). The stadium is
                    named after former BCCI president & former PCA president Inderjit Singh Bindra.

                    The floodlights here are unconventional compared to other cricket stadiums, in that the light
                    pillars are very low in height. This is to avoid aircraft from the nearby Chandigarh airport
                    colliding with the light pillars. That is the reason behind the stadium having 16 floodlights. As of
                    December 2019, it has hosted 13 Tests, 25 ODIs and 5 T20Is.

                    The M. Chinnaswamy Stadium is a cricket stadium in Bangalore, Karnataka, India. It is owned by
                    Government of Karnataka and operated by Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA).[3]
                    Flanked by the picturesque Cubbon Park, Queen's Road, Cubbon and uptown MG Road, this
                    five-decade-old stadium is situated in the heart of the city of Bangalore. It regularly hosts Test,
                    ODI, T20I and first-class cricket matches, as well as musical, cultural events. The stadium is the
                    home ground of the Karnataka state cricket team, Karnataka women's cricket team and IPL franchise
                    Royal Challengers Bangalore. It is owned by the Government of Karnataka and has been leased out
                    to the KSCA for a period of 100 years.
                    Formerly known as the Karnataka State Cricket Association Stadium, it was later rechristened in
                    tribute to Mangalam Chinnaswamy, a lawyer from Mandya and the founding member of the Mysore State
                    Cricket Association.[5] He served the KSCA for four decades and was also president of the Board of
                    Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) from 1977 to 1980, latter's National Cricket Academy also
                    situated in the premises of this stadium.
                    It is the first cricket stadium in the world to use solar panels to generate a bulk of the
                    electricity needed to run the stadium. The panels were procured through the "Go Green" initiative
                    of the KSCA. In 2016 a water purification plant was added, and by January 2017 a system of
                    aeration and drainage was in place to avoid matches being curtailed due to a wet outfield

                    The Sawai Mansingh Stadium is a cricket stadium in Jaipur, Rajasthan, India. It was named after
                    Sawai Man Singh II, the former Maharaja of the state of Jaipur. The stadium seats 30,000. As of July
                    2013, the stadium and grounds could be toured using Google Street View. As of 18 Jan 2024 it has
                    hosted 1 Test, 19 ODIs and 1 T20I.
                    The Sawai Mansingh Stadium has hosted a solitary Test match, between India and Pakistan, starting in
                    February 1987, when Pakistan President General Zia-ul-Haq crossed the border to watch the second
                    day's play as part of his "Cricket for Peace" initiative.
                    The Test was notable for Younis Ahmed's return to the Test fray after an absence of over 17 years
                    and also for Sunil Gavaskar's dismissal to the first ball of the Test match, for the third time in
                    an otherwise illustrious career.to collect
                    The game sputtered to a draw after the third day's play was abandoned following heavy rain and a
                    controversy over the alleged deposition of sawdust on the wicket which Pakistan objected to.
                    The stadium's ODI debut had kicked off with a contest between the same two sides on 2 October 1983.
                    Fresh from their World Cup triumph, the Indians comfortably won by four wickets, sporting the same
                    XI that won the World Cup final.
                    The ground has also hosted two World Cup matches in 1987 and 1996 respectively, the West Indians
                    losing to England in the former and beating Australia in the latter. The last ODI played on the
                    ground is between India and Australia in October 2013 which they won comfortably by just losing one
                    wicket chasing 362 in just 43.3 overs although it was a disgustingly flat wicket which provided
                    nothing for the bowlers in the slightest.

                    The Inderjit Singh Bindra Stadium is a cricket ground located in Mohali, Punjab, India. It is
                    popularly referred to as the Mohali Stadium. The stadium was built by Geetanshu Kalra is home to the
                    Punjab team. The construction of the stadium took around ₹ 250 million and 3 years to complete.[1]
                    The stadium has an official capacity of 26,950[2] spectators. The stadium was designed by Ar. Arun
                    Loomba and Associates, and constructed by R.S. Construction Company based in Chandigarh.[3] Inderjit
                    Singh Bindra stadium is home of Punjab cricket team and Punjab Kings (IPL franchise). The stadium is
                    named after former BCCI president & former PCA president Inderjit Singh Bindra.
                    The floodlights here are unconventional compared to other cricket stadiums, in that the light
                    pillars are very low in height. This is to avoid aircraft from the nearby Chandigarh airport
                    colliding with the light pillars. That is the reason behind the stadium having 16 floodlights. As of
                    December 2019, it has hosted 13 Tests, 25 ODIs and 5 T20Is.

                    The Arun Jaitley Stadium is a cricket stadium owned and operated by the Delhi & District Cricket
                    Association (DDCA) and located on Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg, New Delhi.[2][3] It was established in
                    1883 as the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium, and named after the nearby Kotla fort. It is the second oldest
                    functional international cricket stadium in India, after the Eden Gardens of Kolkata. As of 25
                    October 2019, it has hosted 36 Tests, 29 ODIs and 6 T20I.
                    In a 2017 felicitation ceremony, the DDCA named four stands of the stadium after former India
                    captain Bishan Singh Bedi, former India all-rounder Mohinder Amarnath, former India and Delhi opener
                    Gautam Gambhir. The home team's dressing room was named after Raman Lamba and the away dressing room
                    after Prakash Bhandari.
                    On 12 September 2019, the stadium was renamed in memory of former DDCA President and Finance
                    Minister Arun Jaitley, after his death on 24 August 2019. DDCA president Rajat Sharma said: "It was
                    Arun Jaitley's support and encouragement that players like Virat Kohli, Virender Sehwag, Gautam
                    Gambhir, Ashish Nehra, Rishabh Pant and many others could make India proud."[5] Arun Jaitley has
                    also been credited with turning the stadium into a modern facility, increasing its seating capacity
                    and building better facilities for players during his tenure as DDCA president. The stadium was
                    officially renamed at a function that took place on 12 September 2019. One of the stands of the
                    stadium was named after former Indian captain Virat Kohli on the same date. The name change has been
                    criticised by former Indian captain Bishan Singh Bedi.[6] After announcing the name change, DDCA
                    clarified that only the stadium had been renamed and that the ground would be still called the Feroz
                    Shah Kotla Ground.
                    As of 2024, the India national cricket team had been undefeated for over 37 years in Test
                    matches.[7] India's 12-year unbeaten run in ODIs was brought to an end during Australia's tour of
                    India in 2018-19.

                    international cricket stadium in Mumbai, India.[3] It is owned and operated by Mumbai Cricket
                    Association (MCA) and is the home ground of the Mumbai Indians. It houses the headquarters of MCA,
                    the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), and the Indian Premier League (IPL).
                    The stadium is situated near Marine Drive in the Churchgate neighbourhood. Several old cricket clubs
                    are near the stadium, including Hindu Gymkhana, Parsi Gymkhana and Cricket Club of India (CCI).
                    The stadium has been host to numerous high-profile cricket matches in the past, most notably the
                    2011 Cricket World Cup Final, in which India defeated Sri Lanka and became the first country to win
                    the Cricket World Cup on home soil. It hosted the last match of Sachin Tendulkar's international
                    career.
                    Wankhede Stadium was built after disputes between the CCI, which owns Brabourne Stadium, and the
                    Bombay Cricket Association (BCA; now Mumbai Cricket Association) over the allocation of tickets for
                    cricket matches.[4] This became severe after the Test between India and England in 1973. At the
                    initiative of S. K. Wankhede, a politician and the secretary of the Mumbai Cricket Association, BCA
                    built the new stadium in South Bombay (now South Mumbai) near the Churchgate station by appointing
                    Shashi Prabhu & Associates as their architects and B.E. Billimoria & Co as the contractors. It was
                    named after Wankhede in 1974.[citation needed] It was built in approximately 13 months and opened in
                    time for the final Test between India and the West Indies in 1975.[5] Since then, Wankhede Stadium
                    has been the main cricketing venue in the city.

                    The M. Chinnaswamy Stadium is a cricket stadium in Bangalore, Karnataka, India. It is owned by
                    Government of Karnataka and operated by Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA).[3]
                    Flanked by the picturesque Cubbon Park, Queen's Road, Cubbon and uptown MG Road, this
                    five-decade-old stadium is situated in the heart of the city of Bangalore. It regularly hosts Test,
                    ODI, T20I and first-class cricket matches, as well as musical, cultural events. The stadium is the
                    home ground of the Karnataka state cricket team, Karnataka women's cricket team and IPL franchise
                    Royal Challengers Bangalore. It is owned by the Government of Karnataka and has been leased out
                    to the KSCA for a period of 100 years.
                    Formerly known as the Karnataka State Cricket Association Stadium, it was later rechristened in
                    tribute to Mangalam Chinnaswamy, a lawyer from Mandya and the founding member of the Mysore State
                    Cricket Association.[5] He served the KSCA for four decades and was also president of the Board of
                    Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) from 1977 to 1980, latter's National Cricket Academy also
                    situated in the premises of this stadium.
                    It is the first cricket stadium in the world to use solar panels to generate a bulk of the
                    electricity needed to run the stadium. The panels were procured through the "Go Green" initiative
                    of the KSCA. In 2016 a water purification plant was added, and by January 2017 a system of
                    aeration and drainage was in place to avoid matches being curtailed due to a wet outfield

                    stadium currently has a capacity of 68,000.[7] It is owned and operated by Cricket Association of
                    Bengal (CAB) and is the home ground of the Kolkata Knight Riders. It houses the headquarters of
                    Cricket Association of Bengal.
                    Eden Gardens is often referred to as home of Indian cricket and has also been described as
                    "cricket's answer to the Colosseum" [8] and called the "Mecca of Indian cricket", due to it being
                    the first purpose-built ground for the sport.[9][10] Eden Gardens has hosted matches in major
                    international competitions including the World Cup, World Twenty20 and Asia Cup. In 1987, Eden
                    Gardens became the second stadium to host a World Cup final. The 2016 ICC World Twenty20 final was
                    held at the stadium, with the West Indies beating England in a closely fought encounter. Eden
                    Gardens witnessed a record crowd of 110,564 in the 1996 India Vs Sri Lanka Cricket World Cup Semi
                    Final.
                    The stadium was established in 1864. The origins of its name are uncertain. According to some, the
                    stadium is named after the Eden Gardens park where it is located, itself named after the Eden
                    sisters, Emily and Fanny, of Lord Auckland, the Governor-General of India (1836–1842).[11] Initially
                    named the 'Auckland Circus Gardens',[12][13] the park was renamed to the 'Eden Gardens' in 1841.[14]
                    However, according to popular culture, Babu Rajchandra Das, the zamindar (landlord) of Janbazar,
                    Kolkata and husband of Rani Rashmoni, gifted one of his biggest gardens, Mar Bagan, besides the
                    river Hooghly, to Lord Auckland and his sister Emily Eden in gratitude for their help in saving his
                    third daughter from a fatal disease. The garden was then renamed to the Eden Gardens.

                    for domestic and international cricket matches. It is one of the world's premier cricket stadiums.
                    The Narendra Modi stadium stands on the same plot where the Sardar Patel Stadium was present from
                    1982 to 2015, until its demolition. It served as the main venue of domestic and international
                    cricket in the city till 2015. It hosted some matches during the 1987, 1996, and 2011 ICC World
                    Cups. The Gujarat Cricket Association (GCA) scrapped the Sardar Patel Stadium in 2015 to build a
                    state of the art and the world's biggest cricket stadium. The Narendra Modi stadium is designed by
                    Australia's design firm Populous and built by Larsen and Toubro. It took 5 years to build, at an
                    estimated cost of ₹800 crore (US$100 million). The arena replaced the iconic Melbourne Cricket
                    Ground as the world's largest cricket stadium. The headquarter of the GCA is located in its
                    premises. The Narendra Modi stadium has 4 dressing rooms, 11 center pitches, and 2 practice grounds
                    that can host practice as well as domestic matches etc.
                    On 24 February 2021, the Gujarat Cricket Association (GCA), named this newly built stadium as the
                    Narendra Modi Stadium in honour of the current Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, who was the
                    president of the GCA (2009–2014) and the chief minister of Gujarat (2001–2014). In 2021, the stadium
                    was inaugurated by the president of India, Ram Nath Kovind, in an event he presided over.
                    It was first opened to the public in 2020 amid the Namaste Trump event, organized for president of
                    the United States Donald Trump. On 24 February 2021, the Narendra Modi stadium hosted its first Test
                    match, when home side India played against England, it was also its first ever day-night test
                    game.On 29 September 2022, the opening ceremony of the 36th National games was held in the stadium.
                    The arena hosted the final match of the 2023 ICC World Cup on 19 November

                    The M. Chinnaswamy Stadium is a cricket stadium in Bangalore, Karnataka, India. It is owned by
                    Government of Karnataka and operated by Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA).[3]
                    Flanked by the picturesque Cubbon Park, Queen's Road, Cubbon and uptown MG Road, this
                    five-decade-old stadium is situated in the heart of the city of Bangalore. It regularly hosts Test,
                    ODI, T20I and first-class cricket matches, as well as musical, cultural events. The stadium is the
                    home ground of the Karnataka state cricket team, Karnataka women's cricket team and IPL franchise
                    Royal Challengers Bangalore. It is owned by the Government of Karnataka and has been leased out
                    to the KSCA for a period of 100 years.
                    Formerly known as the Karnataka State Cricket Association Stadium, it was later rechristened in
                    tribute to Mangalam Chinnaswamy, a lawyer from Mandya and the founding member of the Mysore State
                    Cricket Association.[5] He served the KSCA for four decades and was also president of the Board of
                    Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) from 1977 to 1980, latter's National Cricket Academy also
                    situated in the premises of this stadium.
                    It is the first cricket stadium in the world to use solar panels to generate a bulk of the
                    electricity needed to run the stadium. The panels were procured through the "Go Green" initiative
                    of the KSCA. In 2016 a water purification plant was added, and by January 2017 a system of
                    aeration and drainage was in place to avoid matches being curtailed due to a wet outfield

                    The Sawai Mansingh Stadium is a cricket stadium in Jaipur, Rajasthan, India. It was named after
                    Sawai Man Singh II, the former Maharaja of the state of Jaipur. The stadium seats 30,000. As of July
                    2013, the stadium and grounds could be toured using Google Street View. As of 18 Jan 2024 it has
                    hosted 1 Test, 19 ODIs and 1 T20I.
                    The Sawai Mansingh Stadium has hosted a solitary Test match, between India and Pakistan, starting in
                    February 1987, when Pakistan President General Zia-ul-Haq crossed the border to watch the second
                    day's play as part of his "Cricket for Peace" initiative.
                    The Test was notable for Younis Ahmed's return to the Test fray after an absence of over 17 years
                    and also for Sunil Gavaskar's dismissal to the first ball of the Test match, for the third time in
                    an otherwise illustrious career.to collect
                    The game sputtered to a draw after the third day's play was abandoned following heavy rain and a
                    controversy over the alleged deposition of sawdust on the wicket which Pakistan objected to.
                    The stadium's ODI debut had kicked off with a contest between the same two sides on 2 October 1983.
                    Fresh from their World Cup triumph, the Indians comfortably won by four wickets, sporting the same
                    XI that won the World Cup final.
                    The ground has also hosted two World Cup matches in 1987 and 1996 respectively, the West Indians
                    losing to England in the former and beating Australia in the latter. The last ODI played on the
                    ground is between India and Australia in October 2013 which they won comfortably by just losing one
                    wicket chasing 362 in just 43.3 overs although it was a disgustingly flat wicket which provided
                    nothing for the bowlers in the slightest.

                    The Inderjit Singh Bindra Stadium is a cricket ground located in Mohali, Punjab, India. It is
                    popularly referred to as the Mohali Stadium. The stadium was built by Geetanshu Kalra is home to the
                    Punjab team. The construction of the stadium took around ₹ 250 million and 3 years to complete.[1]
                    The stadium has an official capacity of 26,950[2] spectators. The stadium was designed by Ar. Arun
                    Loomba and Associates, and constructed by R.S. Construction Company based in Chandigarh.[3] Inderjit
                    Singh Bindra stadium is home of Punjab cricket team and Punjab Kings (IPL franchise). The stadium is
                    named after former BCCI president & former PCA president Inderjit Singh Bindra.
                    The floodlights here are unconventional compared to other cricket stadiums, in that the light
                    pillars are very low in height. This is to avoid aircraft from the nearby Chandigarh airport
                    colliding with the light pillars. That is the reason behind the stadium having 16 floodlights. As of
                    December 2019, it has hosted 13 Tests, 25 ODIs and 5 T20Is.

                    Eden Gardens is an international cricket stadium in Kolkata, India. Established in 1864, it is the
                    oldest[4][5][6] and second-largest cricket stadium in India and third-largest in the world. The
                    stadium currently has a capacity of 68,000.[7] It is owned and operated by Cricket Association of
                    Bengal (CAB) and is the home ground of the Kolkata Knight Riders. It houses the headquarters of
                    Cricket Association of Bengal.
                    Eden Gardens is often referred to as home of Indian cricket and has also been described as
                    "cricket's answer to the Colosseum" [8] and called the "Mecca of Indian cricket", due to it being
                    the first purpose-built ground for the sport.[9][10] Eden Gardens has hosted matches in major
                    international competitions including the World Cup, World Twenty20 and Asia Cup. In 1987, Eden
                    Gardens became the second stadium to host a World Cup final. The 2016 ICC World Twenty20 final was
                    held at the stadium, with the West Indies beating England in a closely fought encounter. Eden
                    Gardens witnessed a record crowd of 110,564 in the 1996 India Vs Sri Lanka Cricket World Cup Semi
                    Final.
                    The stadium was established in 1864. The origins of its name are uncertain. According to some, the
                    stadium is named after the Eden Gardens park where it is located, itself named after the Eden
                    sisters, Emily and Fanny, of Lord Auckland, the Governor-General of India (1836–1842).[11] Initially
                    named the 'Auckland Circus Gardens',[12][13] the park was renamed to the 'Eden Gardens' in 1841.[14]
                    However, according to popular culture, Babu Rajchandra Das, the zamindar (landlord) of Janbazar,
                    Kolkata and husband of Rani Rashmoni, gifted one of his biggest gardens, Mar Bagan, besides the
                    river Hooghly, to Lord Auckland and his sister Emily Eden in gratitude for their help in saving his
                    third daughter from a fatal disease. The garden was then renamed to the Eden Gardens.

                    The Arun Jaitley Stadium is a cricket stadium owned and operated by the Delhi & District Cricket
                    Association (DDCA) and located on Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg, New Delhi.[2][3] It was established in
                    1883 as the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium, and named after the nearby Kotla fort. It is the second oldest
                    functional international cricket stadium in India, after the Eden Gardens of Kolkata. As of 25
                    October 2019, it has hosted 36 Tests, 29 ODIs and 6 T20I.
                    In a 2017 felicitation ceremony, the DDCA named four stands of the stadium after former India
                    captain Bishan Singh Bedi, former India all-rounder Mohinder Amarnath, former India and Delhi opener
                    Gautam Gambhir. The home team's dressing room was named after Raman Lamba and the away dressing room
                    after Prakash Bhandari.
                    On 12 September 2019, the stadium was renamed in memory of former DDCA President and Finance
                    Minister Arun Jaitley, after his death on 24 August 2019. DDCA president Rajat Sharma said: "It was
                    Arun Jaitley's support and encouragement that players like Virat Kohli, Virender Sehwag, Gautam
                    Gambhir, Ashish Nehra, Rishabh Pant and many others could make India proud."[5] Arun Jaitley has
                    also been credited with turning the stadium into a modern facility, increasing its seating capacity
                    and building better facilities for players during his tenure as DDCA president. The stadium was
                    officially renamed at a function that took place on 12 September 2019. One of the stands of the
                    stadium was named after former Indian captain Virat Kohli on the same date. The name change has been
                    criticised by former Indian captain Bishan Singh Bedi.[6] After announcing the name change, DDCA
                    clarified that only the stadium had been renamed and that the ground would be still called the Feroz
                    Shah Kotla Ground.
                    As of 2024, the India national cricket team had been undefeated for over 37 years in Test
                    matches.[7] India's 12-year unbeaten run in ODIs was brought to an end during Australia's tour of
                    India in 2018-19.

                    Wankhede Stadium is an international cricket stadium in Mumbai, India.[3]
                    It is owned and operated by Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) and is the home ground of the Mumbai
                    Indians. It houses the headquarters of MCA, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), and
                    the Indian Premier League (IPL).
                    The stadium is situated near Marine Drive in the Churchgate neighbourhood. Several old cricket clubs
                    are near the stadium, including Hindu Gymkhana, Parsi Gymkhana and Cricket Club of India (CCI)
                    The stadium has been host to numerous high-profile cricket matches in the past, most notably the
                    2011 Cricket World Cup Final, in which India defeated Sri Lanka and became the first country to win
                    the Cricket World Cup on home soil. It hosted the last match of Sachin Tendulkar's international
                    career.
                    Previous stadiums
                    Mumbai has seen Test matches played at three different grounds. The Mumbai Gymkhana ground hosted
                    the first-ever Test in India, in 1933–34 against England. After World War II, the Cricket Club of
                    India's (CCI) Brabourne Stadium – the second ground of the city – was used for 17 Tests.
                    international cricket stadium in Mumbai, India.[3] It is owned and operated by Mumbai Cricket
                    Association (MCA) and is the home ground of the Mumbai Indians. It houses the headquarters of MCA,
                    the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), and the Indian Premier League (IPL).
                    The stadium is situated near Marine Drive in the Churchgate neighbourhood. Several old cricket clubs
                    are near the stadium, including Hindu Gymkhana, Parsi Gymkhana and Cricket Club of India (CCI).
                    The stadium has been host to numerous high-profile cricket matches in the past, most notably the
                    2011 Cricket World Cup Final, in which India defeated Sri Lanka and became the first country to win
                    the Cricket World Cup on home soil. It hosted the last match of Sachin Tendulkar's international
                    career.
                    Wankhede Stadium was built after disputes between the CCI, which owns Brabourne Stadium, and the
                    Bombay Cricket Association (BCA; now Mumbai Cricket Association) over the allocation of tickets for
                    cricket matches.[4] This became severe after the Test between India and England in 1973. At the
                    initiative of S. K. Wankhede, a politician and the secretary of the Mumbai Cricket Association, BCA
                    built the new stadium in South Bombay (now South Mumbai) near the Churchgate station by appointing
                    Shashi Prabhu & Associates as their architects and B.E. Billimoria & Co as the contractors. It was
                    named after Wankhede in 1974.[citation needed] It was built in approximately 13 months and opened in
                    time for the final Test between India and the West Indies in 1975.[5] Since then, Wankhede Stadium
                    has been the main cricketing venue in the city.

                    The Narendra Modi Stadium (NMS), also known as Motera Stadium, is an international cricket stadium
                    in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India. It is the largest stadium in the world, with a seating capacity of
                    132,000 spectators. The stadium is owned by the Gujarat Cricket Association and serves as the venue
                    for domestic and international cricket matches. It is one of the world's premier cricket stadiums.
                    The Narendra Modi stadium stands on the same plot where the Sardar Patel Stadium was present from
                    1982 to 2015, until its demolition. It served as the main venue of domestic and international
                    cricket in the city till 2015. It hosted some matches during the 1987, 1996, and 2011 ICC World
                    Cups. The Gujarat Cricket Association (GCA) scrapped the Sardar Patel Stadium in 2015 to build a
                    state of the art and the world's biggest cricket stadium. The Narendra Modi stadium is designed by
                    Australia's design firm Populous and built by Larsen and Toubro. It took 5 years to build, at an
                    estimated cost of ₹800 crore (US$100 million). The arena replaced the iconic Melbourne Cricket
                    Ground as the world's largest cricket stadium. The headquarter of the GCA is located in its
                    premises. The Narendra Modi stadium has 4 dressing rooms, 11 center pitches, and 2 practice grounds
                    that can host practice as well as domestic matches etc.
                    On 24 February 2021, the Gujarat Cricket Association (GCA), named this newly built stadium as the
                    Narendra Modi Stadium in honour of the current Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, who was the
                    president of the GCA (2009–2014) and the chief minister of Gujarat (2001–2014). In 2021, the stadium
                    was inaugurated by the president of India, Ram Nath Kovind, in an event he presided over.
                    It was first opened to the public in 2020 amid the Namaste Trump event, organized for president of
                    the United States Donald Trump. On 24 February 2021, the Narendra Modi stadium hosted its first Test
                    match, when home side India played against England, it was also its first ever day-night test
                    game.On 29 September 2022, the opening ceremony of the 36th National games was held in the stadium.
                    The arena hosted the final match of the 2023 ICC World Cup on 19 November

                    The Inderjit Singh Bindra Stadium is a cricket ground located in Mohali, Punjab, India. It is
                    popularly referred to as the Mohali Stadium. The stadium was built by Geetanshu Kalra is home to the
                    Punjab team. The construction of the stadium took around ₹ 250 million and 3 years to complete.[1]
                    The stadium has an official capacity of 26,950[2] spectators. The stadium was designed by Ar. Arun
                    Loomba and Associates, and constructed by R.S. Construction Company based in Chandigarh.[3] Inderjit
                    Singh Bindra stadium is home of Punjab cricket team and Punjab Kings (IPL franchise). The stadium is
                    named after former BCCI president & former PCA president Inderjit Singh Bindra.

                    The floodlights here are unconventional compared to other cricket stadiums, in that the light
                    pillars are very low in height. This is to avoid aircraft from the nearby Chandigarh airport
                    colliding with the light pillars. That is the reason behind the stadium having 16 floodlights. As of
                    December 2019, it has hosted 13 Tests, 25 ODIs and 5 T20Is.

                    The Sawai Mansingh Stadium is a cricket stadium in Jaipur, Rajasthan, India. It was named after
                    Sawai Man Singh II, the former Maharaja of the state of Jaipur. The stadium seats 30,000. As of July
                    2013, the stadium and grounds could be toured using Google Street View. As of 18 Jan 2024 it has
                    hosted 1 Test, 19 ODIs and 1 T20I.
                    The Sawai Mansingh Stadium has hosted a solitary Test match, between India and Pakistan, starting in
                    February 1987, when Pakistan President General Zia-ul-Haq crossed the border to watch the second
                    day's play as part of his "Cricket for Peace" initiative.
                    The Test was notable for Younis Ahmed's return to the Test fray after an absence of over 17 years
                    and also for Sunil Gavaskar's dismissal to the first ball of the Test match, for the third time in
                    an otherwise illustrious career.to collect
                    The game sputtered to a draw after the third day's play was abandoned following heavy rain and a
                    controversy over the alleged deposition of sawdust on the wicket which Pakistan objected to.
                    The stadium's ODI debut had kicked off with a contest between the same two sides on 2 October 1983.
                    Fresh from their World Cup triumph, the Indians comfortably won by four wickets, sporting the same
                    XI that won the World Cup final.
                    The ground has also hosted two World Cup matches in 1987 and 1996 respectively, the West Indians
                    losing to England in the former and beating Australia in the latter. The last ODI played on the
                    ground is between India and Australia in October 2013 which they won comfortably by just losing one
                    wicket chasing 362 in just 43.3 overs although it was a disgustingly flat wicket which provided
                    nothing for the bowlers in the slightest.

                    The M. Chinnaswamy Stadium is a cricket stadium in Bangalore, Karnataka, India. It is owned by
                    Government of Karnataka and operated by Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA).[3]
                    Flanked by the picturesque Cubbon Park, Queen's Road, Cubbon and uptown MG Road, this
                    five-decade-old stadium is situated in the heart of the city of Bangalore. It regularly hosts Test,
                    ODI, T20I and first-class cricket matches, as well as musical, cultural events. The stadium is the
                    home ground of the Karnataka state cricket team, Karnataka women's cricket team and IPL franchise
                    Royal Challengers Bangalore. It is owned by the Government of Karnataka and has been leased out
                    to the KSCA for a period of 100 years.
                    Formerly known as the Karnataka State Cricket Association Stadium, it was later rechristened in
                    tribute to Mangalam Chinnaswamy, a lawyer from Mandya and the founding member of the Mysore State
                    Cricket Association.[5] He served the KSCA for four decades and was also president of the Board of
                    Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) from 1977 to 1980, latter's National Cricket Academy also
                    situated in the premises of this stadium.
                    It is the first cricket stadium in the world to use solar panels to generate a bulk of the
                    electricity needed to run the stadium. The panels were procured through the "Go Green" initiative
                    of the KSCA. In 2016 a water purification plant was added, and by January 2017 a system of
                    aeration and drainage was in place to avoid matches being curtailed due to a wet outfield

                    The Arun Jaitley Stadium is a cricket stadium owned and operated by the Delhi & District Cricket
                    Association (DDCA) and located on Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg, New Delhi.[2][3] It was established in
                    1883 as the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium, and named after the nearby Kotla fort. It is the second oldest
                    functional international cricket stadium in India, after the Eden Gardens of Kolkata. As of 25
                    October 2019, it has hosted 36 Tests, 29 ODIs and 6 T20I.
                    In a 2017 felicitation ceremony, the DDCA named four stands of the stadium after former India
                    captain Bishan Singh Bedi, former India all-rounder Mohinder Amarnath, former India and Delhi opener
                    Gautam Gambhir. The home team's dressing room was named after Raman Lamba and the away dressing room
                    after Prakash Bhandari.
                    On 12 September 2019, the stadium was renamed in memory of former DDCA President and Finance
                    Minister Arun Jaitley, after his death on 24 August 2019. DDCA president Rajat Sharma said: "It was
                    Arun Jaitley's support and encouragement that players like Virat Kohli, Virender Sehwag, Gautam
                    Gambhir, Ashish Nehra, Rishabh Pant and many others could make India proud."[5] Arun Jaitley has
                    also been credited with turning the stadium into a modern facility, increasing its seating capacity
                    and building better facilities for players during his tenure as DDCA president. The stadium was
                    officially renamed at a function that took place on 12 September 2019. One of the stands of the
                    stadium was named after former Indian captain Virat Kohli on the same date. The name change has been
                    criticised by former Indian captain Bishan Singh Bedi.[6] After announcing the name change, DDCA
                    clarified that only the stadium had been renamed and that the ground would be still called the Feroz
                    Shah Kotla Ground.
                    As of 2024, the India national cricket team had been undefeated for over 37 years in Test
                    matches.[7] India's 12-year unbeaten run in ODIs was brought to an end during Australia's tour of
                    India in 2018-19.

                    The Sawai Mansingh Stadium is a cricket stadium in Jaipur, Rajasthan, India. It was named after
                    Sawai Man Singh II, the former Maharaja of the state of Jaipur. The stadium seats 30,000. As of July
                    2013, the stadium and grounds could be toured using Google Street View. As of 18 Jan 2024 it has
                    hosted 1 Test, 19 ODIs and 1 T20I.
                    The Sawai Mansingh Stadium has hosted a solitary Test match, between India and Pakistan, starting in
                    February 1987, when Pakistan President General Zia-ul-Haq crossed the border to watch the second
                    day's play as part of his "Cricket for Peace" initiative.
                    The Test was notable for Younis Ahmed's return to the Test fray after an absence of over 17 years
                    and also for Sunil Gavaskar's dismissal to the first ball of the Test match, for the third time in
                    an otherwise illustrious career.to collect
                    The game sputtered to a draw after the third day's play was abandoned following heavy rain and a
                    controversy over the alleged deposition of sawdust on the wicket which Pakistan objected to.
                    The stadium's ODI debut had kicked off with a contest between the same two sides on 2 October 1983.
                    Fresh from their World Cup triumph, the Indians comfortably won by four wickets, sporting the same
                    XI that won the World Cup final.
                    The ground has also hosted two World Cup matches in 1987 and 1996 respectively, the West Indians
                    losing to England in the former and beating Australia in the latter. The last ODI played on the
                    ground is between India and Australia in October 2013 which they won comfortably by just losing one
                    wicket chasing 362 in just 43.3 overs although it was a disgustingly flat wicket which provided
                    nothing for the bowlers in the slightest.

                    Eden Gardens is an international cricket stadium in Kolkata, India. Established in 1864, it is the
                    oldest and second-largest cricket stadium in India and third-largest in the world. The
                    stadium currently has a capacity of 68,000.[7] It is owned and operated by Cricket Association of
                    Bengal (CAB) and is the home ground of the Kolkata Knight Riders. It houses the headquarters of
                    Cricket Association of Bengal.
                    Eden Gardens is often referred to as home of Indian cricket and has also been described as
                    "cricket's answer to the Colosseum" [8] and called the "Mecca of Indian cricket", due to it being
                    the first purpose-built ground for the sport.[9][10] Eden Gardens has hosted matches in major
                    international competitions including the World Cup, World Twenty20 and Asia Cup. In 1987, Eden
                    Gardens became the second stadium to host a World Cup final. The 2016 ICC World Twenty20 final was
                    held at the stadium, with the West Indies beating England in a closely fought encounter. Eden
                    Gardens witnessed a record crowd of 110,564 in the 1996 India Vs Sri Lanka Cricket World Cup Semi
                    Final.
                    The stadium was established in 1864. The origins of its name are uncertain. According to some, the
                    stadium is named after the Eden Gardens park where it is located, itself named after the Eden
                    sisters, Emily and Fanny, of Lord Auckland, the Governor-General of India (1836–1842).[11] Initially
                    named the 'Auckland Circus Gardens',[12][13] the park was renamed to the 'Eden Gardens' in 1841.[14]
                    However, according to popular culture, Babu Rajchandra Das, the zamindar (landlord) of Janbazar,
                    Kolkata and husband of Rani Rashmoni, gifted one of his biggest gardens, Mar Bagan, besides the
                    river Hooghly, to Lord Auckland and his sister Emily Eden in gratitude for their help in saving his
                    third daughter from a fatal disease. The garden was then renamed to the Eden Gardens.

                    Wankhede Stadium is an international cricket stadium in Mumbai, India.[3]
                    It is owned and operated by Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) and is the home ground of the Mumbai
                    Indians. It houses the headquarters of MCA, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), and
                    the Indian Premier League (IPL).
                    The stadium is situated near Marine Drive in the Churchgate neighbourhood. Several old cricket clubs
                    are near the stadium, including Hindu Gymkhana, Parsi Gymkhana and Cricket Club of India (CCI)
                    The stadium has been host to numerous high-profile cricket matches in the past, most notably the
                    2011 Cricket World Cup Final, in which India defeated Sri Lanka and became the first country to win
                    the Cricket World Cup on home soil. It hosted the last match of Sachin Tendulkar's international
                    career.
                    Previous stadiums
                    Mumbai has seen Test matches played at three different grounds. The Mumbai Gymkhana ground hosted
                    the first-ever Test in India, in 1933–34 against England. After World War II, the Cricket Club of
                    India's (CCI) Brabourne Stadium – the second ground of the city – was used for 17 Tests.
                    international cricket stadium in Mumbai, India.[3] It is owned and operated by Mumbai Cricket
                    Association (MCA) and is the home ground of the Mumbai Indians. It houses the headquarters of MCA,
                    the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), and the Indian Premier League (IPL).
                    The stadium is situated near Marine Drive in the Churchgate neighbourhood. Several old cricket clubs
                    are near the stadium, including Hindu Gymkhana, Parsi Gymkhana and Cricket Club of India (CCI).
                    The stadium has been host to numerous high-profile cricket matches in the past, most notably the
                    2011 Cricket World Cup Final, in which India defeated Sri Lanka and became the first country to win
                    the Cricket World Cup on home soil. It hosted the last match of Sachin Tendulkar's international
                    career.
                    Wankhede Stadium was built after disputes between the CCI, which owns Brabourne Stadium, and the
                    Bombay Cricket Association (BCA; now Mumbai Cricket Association) over the allocation of tickets for
                    cricket matches.[4] This became severe after the Test between India and England in 1973. At the
                    initiative of S. K. Wankhede, a politician and the secretary of the Mumbai Cricket Association, BCA
                    built the new stadium in South Bombay (now South Mumbai) near the Churchgate station by appointing
                    Shashi Prabhu & Associates as their architects and B.E. Billimoria & Co as the contractors. It was
                    named after Wankhede in 1974.[citation needed] It was built in approximately 13 months and opened in
                    time for the final Test between India and the West Indies in 1975.[5] Since then, Wankhede Stadium
                    has been the main cricketing venue in the city.

                    Eden Gardens is an international cricket stadium in Kolkata, India. Established in 1864, it is the
                    oldest[4][5][6] and second-largest cricket stadium in India and third-largest in the world. The
                    stadium currently has a capacity of 68,000.[7] It is owned and operated by Cricket Association of
                    Bengal (CAB) and is the home ground of the Kolkata Knight Riders. It houses the headquarters of
                    Cricket Association of Bengal.
                    Eden Gardens is often referred to as home of Indian cricket and has also been described as
                    "cricket's answer to the Colosseum" [8] and called the "Mecca of Indian cricket", due to it being
                    the first purpose-built ground for the sport.[9][10] Eden Gardens has hosted matches in major
                    international competitions including the World Cup, World Twenty20 and Asia Cup. In 1987, Eden
                    Gardens became the second stadium to host a World Cup final. The 2016 ICC World Twenty20 final was
                    held at the stadium, with the West Indies beating England in a closely fought encounter. Eden
                    Gardens witnessed a record crowd of 110,564 in the 1996 India Vs Sri Lanka Cricket World Cup Semi
                    Final.
                    The stadium was established in 1864. The origins of its name are uncertain. According to some, the
                    stadium is named after the Eden Gardens park where it is located, itself named after the Eden
                    sisters, Emily and Fanny, of Lord Auckland, the Governor-General of India (1836–1842).[11] Initially
                    named the 'Auckland Circus Gardens',[12][13] the park was renamed to the 'Eden Gardens' in 1841.[14]
                    However, according to popular culture, Babu Rajchandra Das, the zamindar (landlord) of Janbazar,
                    Kolkata and husband of Rani Rashmoni, gifted one of his biggest gardens, Mar Bagan, besides the
                    river Hooghly, to Lord Auckland and his sister Emily Eden in gratitude for their help in saving his
                    third daughter from a fatal disease. The garden was then renamed to the Eden Gardens.

                    Wankhede Stadium is an international cricket stadium in Mumbai, India.[3]
                    It is owned and operated by Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) and is the home ground of the Mumbai
                    Indians. It houses the headquarters of MCA, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), and
                    the Indian Premier League (IPL).
                    The stadium is situated near Marine Drive in the Churchgate neighbourhood. Several old cricket clubs
                    are near the stadium, including Hindu Gymkhana, Parsi Gymkhana and Cricket Club of India (CCI)
                    The stadium has been host to numerous high-profile cricket matches in the past, most notably the
                    2011 Cricket World Cup Final, in which India defeated Sri Lanka and became the first country to win
                    the Cricket World Cup on home soil. It hosted the last match of Sachin Tendulkar's international
                    career.
                    Previous stadiums
                    Mumbai has seen Test matches played at three different grounds. The Mumbai Gymkhana ground hosted
                    the first-ever Test in India, in 1933–34 against England. After World War II, the Cricket Club of
                    India's (CCI) Brabourne Stadium – the second ground of the city – was used for 17 Tests.
                    international cricket stadium in Mumbai, India.[3] It is owned and operated by Mumbai Cricket
                    Association (MCA) and is the home ground of the Mumbai Indians. It houses the headquarters of MCA,
                    the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), and the Indian Premier League (IPL).
                    The stadium is situated near Marine Drive in the Churchgate neighbourhood. Several old cricket clubs
                    are near the stadium, including Hindu Gymkhana, Parsi Gymkhana and Cricket Club of India (CCI).
                    The stadium has been host to numerous high-profile cricket matches in the past, most notably the
                    2011 Cricket World Cup Final, in which India defeated Sri Lanka and became the first country to win
                    the Cricket World Cup on home soil. It hosted the last match of Sachin Tendulkar's international
                    career.
                    Wankhede Stadium was built after disputes between the CCI, which owns Brabourne Stadium, and the
                    Bombay Cricket Association (BCA; now Mumbai Cricket Association) over the allocation of tickets for
                    cricket matches.[4] This became severe after the Test between India and England in 1973. At the
                    initiative of S. K. Wankhede, a politician and the secretary of the Mumbai Cricket Association, BCA
                    built the new stadium in South Bombay (now South Mumbai) near the Churchgate station by appointing
                    Shashi Prabhu & Associates as their architects and B.E. Billimoria & Co as the contractors. It was
                    named after Wankhede in 1974.[citation needed] It was built in approximately 13 months and opened in
                    time for the final Test between India and the West Indies in 1975.[5] Since then, Wankhede Stadium
                    has been the main cricketing venue in the city.

                    The Arun Jaitley Stadium is a cricket stadium owned and operated by the Delhi & District Cricket
                    Association (DDCA) and located on Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg, New Delhi.[2][3] It was established in
                    1883 as the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium, and named after the nearby Kotla fort. It is the second oldest
                    functional international cricket stadium in India, after the Eden Gardens of Kolkata. As of 25
                    October 2019, it has hosted 36 Tests, 29 ODIs and 6 T20I.
                    In a 2017 felicitation ceremony, the DDCA named four stands of the stadium after former India
                    captain Bishan Singh Bedi, former India all-rounder Mohinder Amarnath, former India and Delhi opener
                    Gautam Gambhir. The home team's dressing room was named after Raman Lamba and the away dressing room
                    after Prakash Bhandari.
                    On 12 September 2019, the stadium was renamed in memory of former DDCA President and Finance
                    Minister Arun Jaitley, after his death on 24 August 2019. DDCA president Rajat Sharma said: "It was
                    Arun Jaitley's support and encouragement that players like Virat Kohli, Virender Sehwag, Gautam
                    Gambhir, Ashish Nehra, Rishabh Pant and many others could make India proud."[5] Arun Jaitley has
                    also been credited with turning the stadium into a modern facility, increasing its seating capacity
                    and building better facilities for players during his tenure as DDCA president. The stadium was
                    officially renamed at a function that took place on 12 September 2019. One of the stands of the
                    stadium was named after former Indian captain Virat Kohli on the same date. The name change has been
                    criticised by former Indian captain Bishan Singh Bedi.[6] After announcing the name change, DDCA
                    clarified that only the stadium had been renamed and that the ground would be still called the Feroz
                    Shah Kotla Ground.
                    As of 2024, the India national cricket team had been undefeated for over 37 years in Test
                    matches.[7] India's 12-year unbeaten run in ODIs was brought to an end during Australia's tour of
                    India in 2018-19.

                    The Sawai Mansingh Stadium is a cricket stadium in Jaipur, Rajasthan, India. It was named after
                    Sawai Man Singh II, the former Maharaja of the state of Jaipur. The stadium seats 30,000. As of July

                    The Sawai Mansingh Stadium has hosted a solitary Test match, between India and Pakistan, starting in
                    February 1987, when Pakistan President General Zia-ul-Haq crossed the border to watch the second
                    day's play as part of his "Cricket for Peace" initiative.
                    The Test was notable for Younis Ahmed's return to the Test fray after an absence of over 17 years
                    and also for Sunil Gavaskar's dismissal to the first ball of the Test match, for the third time in
                    an otherwise illustrious career.to collect

                    controversy over the alleged deposition of sawdust on the wicket which Pakistan objected to.
                    The stadium's ODI debut had kicked off with a contest between the same two sides on 2 October 1983.
                    Fresh from their World Cup triumph, the Indians comfortably won by four wickets, sporting the same
                    XI that won the World Cup final.
                    The ground has also hosted two World Cup matches in 1987 and 1996 respectively, the West Indians
                    losing to England in the former and beating Australia in the latter. The last ODI played on the
                    ground is between India and Australia in October 2013 which they won comfortably by just losing one
                    wicket chasing 362 in just 43.3 overs although it was a disgustingly flat wicket which provided
                    nothing for the bowlers in the slightest.
